## Idea
Advanced Search & Filtering: Enable users to filter facilities based on the specific e-waste types they accept, such as computers, TVs, or batteries.

Interactive Features: Introduce a quiz or an interactive map to make learning about responsible e-waste disposal more engaging. Provide a "responsible disposal guide" that offers step-by-step instructions for tasks like data wiping and preparing e-waste for recycling.

Data & Insights: Create a system to collect and analyze user-reported data on e-waste types and quantities, providing valuable insights to the Ministry of Environment.

## Technology Stack
Front-End:

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the website.
CSS: Handles the styling of visual elements, including layout, fonts, and colors.
JavaScript Framework: ReactJS is a strong choice for delivering a dynamic and interactive user experience. It allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient management of complex data flows.
Back-End:

Database: PostgreSQL is recommended for storing various data, including:
E-waste facility details (locations, contact information, accepted waste types)
Educational content (text, images, videos)
User data (for a potential reward system) – secure storage practices like password hashing should be used for storing usernames, points, etc.
Device data (for a reward system) – model numbers and corresponding precious metal content (in collaboration with e-waste recycling companies).
API Integration:

Google Maps API: Essential for the facility locator functionality, enabling users to search for nearby facilities, view locations on a map, and get directions.
Optional API: For a reward system, you may need to integrate with APIs from e-waste recycling companies to access data on the precious metal content of various devices.
